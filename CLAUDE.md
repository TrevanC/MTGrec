# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the MTG EDH/Commander Upgrade Recommender - an application that analyzes Magic: The Gathering EDH/Commander decks and provides upgrade recommendations based on synergy scoring, deck statistics, and community data.

**Architecture:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js (React) - Single page application with session-only deck storage
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) - Stateless REST API
- **Database:** PostgreSQL - Stores Scryfall card data and co-occurrence statistics
- **Data Source:** Scryfall bulk data for MTG card information

## Project Structure

This repository is currently in the design phase with comprehensive product specifications in the `docs/` directory:

- `docs/mtg_edh_synergy.md` - Complete product design including user interface wireframes and synergy evaluation methodology
- `docs/mtg_recommender_frontend_backend_design_mvp.md` - Technical MVP specification with API design, database schema, and implementation details

## Key Design Concepts

**Data Model:**
- Cards are stored using the complete Scryfall Card object structure (verbatim)
- Commanders are identified as an attribute of cards (no separate entity)
- Co-occurrence statistics track card relationships for recommendation scoring
- No user deck persistence - decks exist only in browser session storage

**API Design:**
- Stateless endpoints at `/api/v1`
- Key endpoints: `/deck/parse`, `/recommend`, `/cards`
- Uniform error response format with specific error codes
- Scryfall-compatible response structures

**Frontend Flow:**
1. User pastes decklist â†’ parse via API
2. Store parsed deck in session storage
3. Generate recommendations via API
4. Display with configurable explanation levels
5. Optional feedback tracking for analytics

**Synergy Evaluation (Multi-layer):**
- Tag overlap using Scryfall metadata
- Commander-to-card synergy analysis
- Card-to-card resource producer/consumer matching
- Category balance evaluation (enablers vs payoffs)
- Historical co-occurrence from community data

## Development Status

This repository contains design documentation only. Implementation has not yet begun.

When implementation starts, the typical development workflow will be:
- Backend: FastAPI with PostgreSQL, using SQLAlchemy
- Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript, session-based state management
- Testing: Follow standard practices for the chosen frameworks
- Data pipeline: Scryfall bulk data import and processing
