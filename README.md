# ðŸ§™ Magic: The Gathering EDH Deck Recommender

## Overview  
This project builds a tool that, given a **Magic: The Gathering EDH decklist**, can **analyze the deck** and **recommend additional cards** to include.  

Magic: The Gathering cards can be complex, and EDH decks consist of 100 unique cards. Currently, thereâ€™s no automated tool to assist with the deckbuilding process. This project aims to fill that gap by evaluating decklists and providing intelligent recommendations.

## Project Structure

### 1. Card-Tagger  
Available card data is limited to surface-level information and unprocessed string text.  
This component creates a **tagging system** to categorize cards by functionality, enabling meaningful evaluations and algorithmic recommendations.

- Develop a shared **taxonomy and schema** to structure card information  
- Use **LLMs** to tag cards in bulk based on functionality  
- Output a **database of commander-legal cards** with structured tags

---

### 2. Deck-Lists  
This portion focuses on leveraging existing public decklists to power a recommender system.

- Automated **web-scraping** of decklists from community sites  
- Utilize **Archidektâ€™s public API** to collect deck data  
- Implement scraping pipelines with politeness delays to avoid throttling

---

### 3. Card-Rec (Recommendation Tool)  
The actual user-facing tool, implemented as a **website** with front end, back end, database, and recommendation engine.

- **Front end:** Decklist input, display, and summary UI inspired by existing MTG tools  
- **Back end:** Processes decklists and fetches card data from the **Scryfall API**  
- **Recommendation system:**  
  - Currently: collaborative filtering (recommendations based on community overlap)  
  - Future: tag/synergy-based recommendation algorithm

## Key Learnings

### Tagging with LLMs
- Developed a **taxonomy and schema** with 7 categories to structure card functionalities  
- Iterated with an LLM to refine the taxonomy and automate tagging at scale  
- Batched processing to handle 30â€“40k unique cards efficiently (~$20 in prompt cost)

### Web Scraping
- Learned to scrape and collect **decklist IDs** efficiently  
- Used **Archidektâ€™s API + scraping** to gather hundreds of decklists  
- Built automated collection with **politeness delays** to avoid getting blocked

### Web Development
- Gained experience setting up a basic **full-stack application**  
- Integrated UI components, database interactions, and recommendation algorithms

---

## Current Setup
- **Taxonomy + schema** provide structured context for LLM extraction  
- Command-line tool supports batch tagging by color identity and batch size  
- Result: Database of every commander-legal card with tags for functional evaluation

---

## Challenges
- **Large dataset:** 30â€“40k unique cards + card text  
- **Evaluation difficulty:** Some card functions are not easily parsed with regex or simple text extraction and require LLM-based understanding

---

## TODO
- Identify remaining card functions that can be parsed without LLMs  
- Use tagged card data to evaluate decklists in the recommender system  
- Add screenshots, analysis notebooks, and UI examples to the README

---

## Goal  
Tag Magic cards at scale to **evaluate decklists and overall strategies**, enabling more intelligent and automated EDH deck recommendations.
